      implemented across the country after the decision of MoH on 2071/6/28
      (October 14, 2015). This integrated package of child‐survival intervention
      addresses the major problem of sick newborn such as birth asphyxia,
      bacterial infection, jaundice, hypothermia, low birth weight, counseling

      and child health and dispensing of essential commodities which do not
      require assessment and diagnostic skills like distribution of iron, zinc,
      ORS, chlorhexidine and immediate referral in case of any danger signs
      appear among sick newborn and child. And health workers will counsel, and
      provided the health service like management of non‐breathing cases, skin
      to skin contact and management of neonatal sepsis and common childhood
      illness. Also program has provisioned the post‐natal visits by trained
      health workers through primary health care outreach clinic. For treatment

      National Immunization Programme (NIP) is the priority 1 (P1) program of
      Nepal. Launched as “Expanded Program on Immunization” in 2034 BS, national
      Immunization program has met several milestones during the past decades,
      including reduction of under 5 mortality goal (MDG 4). National
      immunization program provides equitable services to the geographically,
      economically hard to reach, marginalized community through more than
      16,000 outreach sessions. Currently, 11 antigens are provided through
      national immunization program. The new initiatives of "Reaching Every
      Child" through declaring country as Fully Immunized initiated in 2012 has
      gained its height through community involvement and as of the date 18
      districts and more than 1800 VDCs have been declared as fully immunized.
      Nepal is polio free since 2010 and has switched to bOPV from tOPV since
      April 17 2016 (Baisakh 5 2073). Maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination
      status has been sustained since 2005. The burden of Japanese encephalitis
      has been successfully reduced during the reporting period. The progress
      towards the measles elimination and control of rubella /congenital rubella
      syndrome by 2019 is in progress. A new guideline on measles case based
      surveillance and Rubella/CRS control has been drafted and underway to
      endorsement.

    <p>
      Nutrition interventions have been proved as one of the most cost effective
      investments for overall socio-economic development by enhancing human
      capital through improved productivity of the population. Hence,
      nutritional well-being of the population is crucial for accelerated
      attainment of many of the Sustainable Development Goals. In an alignment
      with several international and national declarations and National Health
      Policies including International Conference on Nutrition, Government of
      Nepal is committed to its citizens for adequate food, health and nutrition
      to maintain their nutritional well-being. The Constitution has also
      ensured the right to food, health and nutrition to all citizens in Nepal.
      Failing to ensure protection of the population from the hunger and
      under-nutrition often results in the vicious cycle of malnutrition and
      infections leading to poor cognitive and intellectual development
      adversely affecting which, in turn, lead to less productivity leading to
      compromised socio-economic development. When combined with household food
      insecurity, frequent illness and infections, inadequate dietary intake,
      poor hygiene, care and practices, the cycle of inter-generational
      malnutrition comes into existence and continues.
