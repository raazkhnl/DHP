    <p>
      Malaria control project in Nepal was first initiated in 1954 with the
      support from USAID (the then USOM), with the objective of controlling
      malaria, mainly in plain region (Terai belt) of central Nepal. In 1958,
      national malaria eradication program was launched with the objective of
      eradicating malaria from the country. Due to various reasons the
      eradication concept reverted to control program in 1978. Following the
      call of WHO to revamp the malaria control programs in 1998, Roll Back
      Malaria (RBM) initiative was launched to control malaria transmission in
      hard-core forests, foot-hills, inner-Terai and hill river valleys, which
      accounted for more than 70% of the total malaria cases in the country. The
      high risk of acquiring the disease is attributed to the abundance of
      vector mosquitoes, mobile and vulnerable population, relative
      inaccessibility of the area, suitable temperature, environmental and
      socio-economic factors. The recent micro-stratification, based on number
      of malaria cases, geo-ecology, vector breeding and vulnerability due to
      migration and population movements, further narrowed down the essentials
      to VDC level risks as compared to earlier district as units of risks. It
      has clearly shown that only 54 VDC’s are at high risk, 201 VDC’s at
      moderate risk and 999 VDC’s at low risk. Based on the micro-stratification
      report 2013, approximately 13.02 million population (47.9%) live in
      malaria endemic areas (VDCS); out of which ~1 million (3.62%) live in high
      risk VDCs, 2.66 million (9.8%) live in moderate risk VDCs, and 9.38
      million(34.52%) live in low risk VDCs. A total population of 14.13 (52.1%)
      is estimated to live in VDCs where there is no malaria transmission. The
      high risk areas consist of foothills with river belts, forest fringe areas
      in terai, hill river valleys, and inner terai areas. Low risk VDCs lie in
      plain cultivated outer Terai, mountain, and valleys in the mountains.

    <p>
      Kala-azar is a vector-borne disease caused by parasite Leishmania
      donovani, transmitted by the sand fly, Phlebotomusargentipes. The disease
      is characterized by fever for more than two weeks with spleenomegaly,
      anaemia, and progressive weight loss and sometimes darkening of the skin.
      In the endemic areas, children and young adults are its principal victims.
      The disease is fatal if it is not treated timely. Kala-azar and HIV/TB
      co-infections have emerged as a health problem in recent years. The
      government of Nepal has committed to the regional strategy to eliminate
      Kala-azar, and is a signatory (along with India and Bangladesh) of the
      memorandum of understanding that was formalized during the World Health
      Assembly 2005 on Kala-azar elimination. The target of this memorandum is
      achieving Kala-azar disease elimination by 2015. In 2005, Epidemiology and
      Disease Control Division (EDCD) of Department of Health Services also
      formulated a National Plan for the Elimination of Kala-azar, which is
      divided into three phases: Preparatory Phase: 2005-2008 Attack Phase:
      2008-2015 Consolidation Phase: 2015 onwards. The target is to reduce the
      annual incidence of Kala-azar to less than 1 per 10,000 populations at the
      district level by 2015. Over the last decade, there have been some
      significant advances both in the diagnosis and treatment of Kala-azar. The
      rK39 dipstick test kit, a rapid and easily applicable serological test has
      been widely used in the Indian subcontinent including Nepal. The national
      programme to eliminate KA in Nepal has made this test kit available up to
      PHC level of programme districts.

      Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease emerged in Nepal in the form of Dengue
      Fever (DF), Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome
      (DSS). The earliest cases were detected as early as 2005. The sporadic
      cases continued and outbreaks occurred in 2006 and 2010. Initially most of
      the reported cases had travel history to neighbouring country (India),
      however lately indigenous cases were also reported. The affected districts
      were Chitwan, Kanchanpur, Kailali, Banke, Bardiya, Dang, Kapilvastu,
      Parsa, Rupandehi, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Saptari and Jhapa, indicating spread
      throughout the country from west to east lying in the plain Terai region.
      During 2011, 79 confirmed cases were reported from 15 districts with the
      highest case incidence in Chitwan (n=55) Aedes aegipti (mosquito-vector)
      has been identified in 5 peri-urban areas of Terai region (Kailali, Dang,
      Chitwan, Parsa and Jhapa) during entomological surveillance conducted by
      EDCD during the year 2006-2010, indicating local transmission of dengue.
      Studies carried out in close collaboration with WARUN/AFRIMS in the year
      2006 by EDCD/NPHL showed all 4 sub-types (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4)
      of Dengue virus circulation in Nepal.

      The six zoonoses like Taeniosis/cysticercosis /Neurocysticercosis,
      Leptospirosis, Hydatidosis, Brucellosis; Toxoplasmosis and Avian Influenza
      have been identified as Priorities Zoonotic Diseases in Nepal as they are
      found to have epidemic potential. More than 35000 people take
      post-exposure treatment in suspicious or rabid animal bite per annum and
      about 100 people die annually due to rabies. Likewise, snake-bite is a key
      medical emergency and cause of hospital admission. It results in the death
      or chronic disability of many active young people, especially those
      involved in farming and plantation. Number of case of dog and snake bites
      is increasing in the country but there is a decreasing trend of death. The
      Department of Health Services, Epidemiology and Disease Control Division
      (EDCD) responds timely to reduce human sufferings and deaths due to
      poisonous snake bites, control and prevent rabies and other zoonosis in
      coordination and collaboration with public, non-governmental and private
      partners.

      Nepal has achieved the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem
      in December 2009 and declared elimination in 2010. Department of Health
      Services acknowledged the achievement as one of the major success stories
      of the health sector in the past decades. Although significant progress
      has been made in reducing the disease burden at national level, sustaining
      the achievement & further reducing the disease burden through delivering
      quality leprosy services still remain as major challenge. After meeting
      the elimination target at national level, the national strategy was
      revised to “Sustain Quality Leprosy Services and Further Reduce the
      Disease Burden due to Leprosy in Nepal: 2011-2015″ based on the “Enhanced
      Global Strategy for Further Reducing the Disease Burden Due to Leprosy:
      2011-2015″ and the updated national Operational Guideline is developed
      based upon WHO guideline. The main principles of leprosy control are based
      on early detection of new cases and timely treatment with multi-drug
      therapy (MDT) through integrated health services. Major target for 2020 is
      to reduce grade II disability below 1 per million.

      Pursuant to its goal of achieving universal access to prevention,
      treatment care and support, HIV Testing Services (HTS) has been a
      strategic focus in the national response to HIV ever since Nepal started
      its response to HIV. The first ever HTC began in 1995 with the approach of
      voluntary Client-Initiated Testing and Counseling (CITC). Moving further
      from its previous approach of voluntary CITC, the national HIV testing and
      counseling program has been later widened to include Provider-Initiated
      Testing and Counseling (PITC), as well as CITC as crucial components of
      the nation’s fight against HIV. With the expansion of HTC sites across the
      country, there has been parallel development. National Guidelines on HTC
      was formulated in 2003 and updated in 2007, 2009 and 2011 and later on the
      separate guideline is merged as comprehensive guideline on treating and
      preventing HIV in 2014, community-based HIV testing is recommended to
      cover HIV screening widerA new consolidated guideline on treating and
      preventing HIV is being endorsed and will be finalized by the end of
      December 2016, which would recommend for community led testing. Human
      resources for HTC have been trained for public health facilities as well
      as NGOs-run HTS sites. A new National HIV Strategic Plan 2016-2021 is
      recently launched to achieve ambitious global goals of 90-90-90. By 2020,
      90% of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status by 2020, 90%
      of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained
      antiretroviral therapy andby 2020, 90% of all people receiving
      antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression. HIV and STI
      counselling and testing is available up to the health post level and
      through the stand alone HTC sites run by the NGOs.
