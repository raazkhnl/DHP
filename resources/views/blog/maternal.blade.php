    <p>
      The goal of the National Safe Motherhood Program is to reduce maternal and
      neonatal morbidity and mortality and to improve the maternal and neonatal
      health through preventive and promotive activities as well as by
      addressing avoidable factors that cause death during pregnancy, childbirth
      and postpartum period. Evidences suggest that three delays are important
      factors behind the maternal and new born.

    <hr />

   
    <p>
      Recognizing the importance of women's participation in promoting health of
      the people, GoN initiated the Female Community Health Volunteer (FCHV)
      Program in FY 2045/46 (1988/1989) in 27 districts and expanded to all 75
      districts of the country in a phased manner. Initially, the approach was
      to select one FCHV per ward regardless of the population size. Later in
      2050 (1993/94) population based approach was introduced in selected (28)
      districts. All together there are 51,416 FCHVs in the country (46,088
      FCHVs at rural/VDC level and 5,328 at urban/municipality level). FCHVs are
      selected by members of Mothers' Group for Health (MG‐H) with the help of
      local health facility staff. They are provided 18 days basic training in
      two phases (9+9 days) on selected primary health care components. The
      major role of the FCHV is to advocate healthy behaviors of mothers and
      community people to promote safe motherhood, child health, family
      planning, and other community based health promotion and service delivery.
      FCHVs distribute condoms and pills, ORS packets and vitamin A capsules,
      treat pneumonia cases and refer and serious cases to health institution
      along with motivation and education to community people. Similarly, they
      also distribute iron tablets to pregnant women. The FCHV program strategy
      has been revised in 2067 (2010) which gave strategic directions and
      critical approaches to ensure a strengthened national program for
      consistency and continuous support to each FCHV. Government of Nepal (GoN)
      is committed to increase the moral & participation of FCHV in community
      health development. In fiscal year 2064/65 MoH established FCHVs fund by
      providing cash support of Rs. 50,000 to each VDC. The mobilization of this
      fund for income generation activities is expected to benefit the FCHVs and
      the community at large.

    <hr />


    <p>
      The overall goal of the National ASRH Program is to promote the sexual and
      reproductive health status of adolescents. The major target of the program
      was to make 1,000 health facilities adolescent‐friendly by 2015. The NHSS
      has envisioned that all the services provided through the public health
      facilities will be friendly in all the districts. . Through improving
      access to family planning information and devices, the program aims to
      reduce the Adolescent Fertility Rate (AFR) which is the outcome indicator
      of NHSS. As of 2016, 1534 health facilities are already adolescent
      friendly.

      <h1>Primary Health Care Outreach Progamme</h1>
    </div>
    <hr />


    <p>
      As envisaged in the National Health Policy 1991, health facilities were
      extended up to village level. However, utilization of services provided by
      health facilities, especially preventive and promotive services, has been
      found to be limited because of limited accessibility. Therefore it was
      felt that services should be expanded closer to the community. Thus
      Primary Health Care Outreach (PHC/ORC) services was initiated and
      established in 1994 (2051 BS). The aim of PHC/ORC is to improve access to
      some basic health services including family planning, child health and
      safe motherhood closer to rural households. These clinics are the service
      extension sites of PHCCs, HPs and up to community level.
